# C Programming Tutorial for Beginners - Files

A repository containing all files developed in ["Zingaro, Daniel (2021) Algorithmic Thinking - A Problem-Based Introduction"](https://nostarch.com/algorithmic-thinking).

In the words of the Author himself:

*"This book is for any programmer who wants to learn how to solve tough problems. You’ll learn many data structures and algorithms, their benefits, the types of problems they can help you solve, and how to implement them."*

*"Each problem ... is available on a programming-judge website."*

## Description

This repository introduces some basic concepts of Data Structure, such as:
- Hash Tables;
- Trees and Recursion;
- Memoization and Dynamic Programming;
- Graphs;

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* A C/C++ compiler, such as Mingw GCC. Some other options can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compilers#C_compilers).

### Executing program

<b>To compile and execute a .c file: </b>
- Using a terminal, such as CMD or PowerShell.
    * Open a new terminal and move to ~/source folder.
    * Run the following command:
        > gcc filename.c -o filename
    * After generate the .exe, run the following command:
        > .\filename.exe
- Using a IDE, such as visual code.
    * Install [C/C++ recommended extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack) and [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner).
    * In the explorer tab, open the desired file.
    * Run the code using (Ctrl + Alt + n)
